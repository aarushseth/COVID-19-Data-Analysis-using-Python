<h1>COVID'19 Data Analysis using Python</h1>
<p>
<h2>This is a project-based course on Coursera which takes approximately 2 hours to finish. </h2>
In this course, you will: <br>
1. Learn the steps, needed to be taken to prepare your data sources for an analysis<br>
2. Learn how to look at your data to find a good measure to establish your analysis based upon<br>
3. Learn to visualize the result of your analysis<br>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
The hands on project on COVID19 Data Analysis using Python is divided into following tasks:<br>
<b>1: Introduction</b> Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis.<br>
<b>2: Importing COVID19 dataset</b> Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.<br>
<b>3: Finding a good Measure</b> Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.<br>
<b>4: Importing World happiness report dataset</b> Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.<br>
<b>5: Visualizing the results</b> Visualize our results using Seaborn.<br><br>
